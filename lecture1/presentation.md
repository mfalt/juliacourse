## What is Julia?
The Julia Language: A fresh approach to technical computing.

- Dynamically typed
- "Optionally typed"
- High-level language, simple syntax
- Multiple dispatch

- Version 0.1 Released Feb 2013
- Version 1.0 Released Aug 2018
- Latest version 1.2
- (I use 1.3-rc2 for the threading)


## Why use Julia?
- Solves the dual-language problem. From ThinkJulia.jl :
*Julia is a unique programming language because it solves
the so-called two languages problem. No other program-
ming language is needed to write high-performance code.
This does not mean it happens automatically. It is the re-
sponsability of the programmer to optimize the code that
forms a bottleneck but this can done in Julia itself.*

## Why use Julia?
- Open source and free: The whole language and all packages!
- Possible to understand what is going on, Julia is written in Julia!
- Easy to get started
- Many third party libraries (3000+, not as many as Python)
